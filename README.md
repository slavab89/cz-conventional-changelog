# cz-conventional-changelog

Part of the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) family. Prompts for [conventional changelog](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/index.js) standard.

The only change from the original package is that i place the ISSUES section at the `head` part instead of the footer.

When using Bitbucket it allows JIRA issues to be auto-highlighted
